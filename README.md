# 📊 KPIM Mart Sales Analytics Dashboard
> Capstone Project · December 2025

## Overview
An interactive Sales Performance Report built in Power BI to help retail leadership monitor overall business performance — from high-level KPIs down to individual store managers and product groups.

## Goals
Leadership needed a single dashboard to:
- Track key KPIs — Total Revenue, Total Orders, Total Products Sold, and Number of Customers — by reporting year
- Break down each KPI across regions, stores, product categories, and product groups
- Monitor monthly trends within a selected reporting year
- View a detailed revenue table by manager with year-over-year growth compared to the same period last year (applied similarly across product groups)
